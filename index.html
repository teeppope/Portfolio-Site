                <p>I came to web development with a background in design while following my curiosity to learn how the digital world is built. I see web development as digital crafting. Using various coding language and building an interactive online experience to help users achieve their goals, is just so cool and important.</p>
                <p>I’ve been working as a Front End Developer for 7 years in agency and freelance capacities and along the way have established a development approach based on kindness, compassion and empathy for all users. I structure project code with a focus on digital accessibility, site performance and user experience utilizing the latest HTML, CSS, and Javascript techniques.</p>

                            <p>Growing up I was always drawn to the intersection of art and sciences. The birth of the internet and video games introduced me to the digital world. Sites like Neopets, and summers spent playing Mario Kart, opened my eyes to a way art and science could be combined in creative ways.</p>
                            <p>After high school I turned my eye towards learning Graphic Design, receiving a Diploma in Graphic Communications and Print Design from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and moved from Calgary to Vancouver to pursue a job as a UI Designer at a web design and development company with two close friends. Working alongside these friends showed me the world of coding and really sparked my interest in building the digital world, and the creativity that goes into turning designs into an interactive reality.</p>
                            <p>In the Summer of 2016, after working for a year as an Office Manager at Skyrocket Digital, I attended the Web Development bootcamp course at Red Academy in Vancouver to switch gears from designer to developer. This course involved learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Wordpress, PHP, web accessibility and introduced me to Angular/React, build tools, github and some really great people.</p>
                            <p>For the past 7 years I’ve worked freelance and at digital agencies building and maintaining websites for clients in the hospitality, tourism, healthcare, and technology industries. Working primarily on Wordpress websites, I’ve focussed on web accessibility, performance and building enjoyable user experiences. Working closely with designers, project managers and clients, I’ve been actively involved in all stages of a projects life cycle providing an organized approach to the technical process. I’ve also gotten the opportunity to work on Shopfiy, Squarespace, and React projects over the years.</p>
                            <p>Lately I’ve been dabbling with static site generators, continuing to expand my web accessibility knowledge and growing my skillsets in the physical world through sewing clothing and crocheting.</p>

                    <p>Bushtops Camps is a collection of luxury safari destinations in Kenya and Tanzania run by the Stuart Family. In late 2019 they rebranded, requiring a newly designed and built website to showcase the new branding. We built the new website on Wordpress, creating a new custom theme built with Twig templating, Sass, and Vanilla JS.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented the newly branded design system through the creation of reuse-able flexible content modules using Advanced Custom Fields for an easy authoring experience</li>
                        <li>Maintained site Accessibility throughout the content modules through the use of conditional logic within the Twig templating language</li>
                        <li>Utilized the Google Maps API and wildebeest migration data to create a <a href="https://bushtopscamps.com/experiences/wildebeest-migration/#migration-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wildebeest Migration Map</a> to showcase where the migration overlaps with Bushtops camp locations throughout the year</li>
