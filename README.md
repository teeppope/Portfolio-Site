#My Portfolio Landing Page

I designed and built this landing page to act as a stand-in (portfolio site)[https://terrapope.com "Go to my site!"] while I get the main site up and running. 

##Technology Used
HTML5
SASS compiled down into CSS3
JavaScript ES6 syntax
Webpack2 as the build tool.

##Purpose
This was built with re-useability in mind to be used for future projects which need a quick under construction page. If you want to clone this repo, just npm init and then run "npm run start" in a CLI to get this light weight landing page off the ground. Then just replace the assets with your own and you're on your way.
